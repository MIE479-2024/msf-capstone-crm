### Meeting Minute 

#### Train the model with dataset containing only default and non-default
- **Data preprocessing**
  - Include variables such as DLQ_FLAG (ever bad), Current_DLQ (current bad), Ongoing, Prepaid_Matured, â€¦
  - Status: *In progress*
- **VM training**
  - Experiment with other kernels, hyperparameters, etc.
- **SVM optimization**
- **Apply segmentation to classifier models**

#### Ask Prof. Kwon if we should include Covid data?

#### Look for methods to incorporate prepayment into model
- Current research shows correlation between default and prepayment (Dual Trigger Theory)
- **Correlation analysis** between default and prepayment?
- Test whether default model is also effective in predicting prepayment.

#### Tentative
- Develop function to calculate Portfolio YTM
