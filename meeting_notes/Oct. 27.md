##train the model with dataset containing only default and non default
*Data preprocessing 
**to include DLQ_FLAG (ever bad),  Current_DLQ (current bad), Ongoing, Prepaid_Matured,  â€¦ 
**In progress 
*VM training - try other kernels, hyperparameters etc
*SVM optimization 
*Apply segmentation to classifier models
##Ask Prof.Kwon if we should include Covid data?
##Look for methods to incorporate prepayment into model: current research show correlation between default and prepayment (Dual trigger theory)
*Correlation analysis between default and prepayment?
*Test whether default model is good at predicting prepayment as well

##Tentative
*Function to calculate Portfolio YTM
