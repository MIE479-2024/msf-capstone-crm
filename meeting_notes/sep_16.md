# Questions to ask at next check-in 
- Are we allowed to include other datasets as well, e.g. median sales price, to account for more long term patterns?
- 

# Next steps identified
- Understand fields from dropbox dataset
- Compile a list of third-party datasets to include
    - [House data by zip-code, city, state, etc.](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/)
    - [Federal reserve source](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/97)
- Read over relevant paper on GitHub prior to meeting
    - After meeting identify next steps
